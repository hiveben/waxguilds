We purchased additional servers to the AA API due to the increasing demand.

## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Continuing to support/maintain bountyblok.io, distribution drop tool, and GIFT NFT. 

giftnft:

Embedded Claim Button: wax.giftnft.io launched an embeddable “CLAIM NFT” button (currently in BETA Testing) allowing you to place it within your static web page in order to offer easy ways for users to claim an NFT. It is configurable and allows you specify a templateID, button styling, start/end dates, max claims, etc.

Ad Campaigns: Giftnft can now be used in marketing campaigns. The Ad below is an example of a live YouTube Ads campaign that sends users to the Green NFT landing page where they can claim their free NFT. 

bountyblok.io: we are working on a massive end user contest creator module - think Gleam with NFTs - will be going into beta very soon.
